FILE 

* Implement Save
* Implement Save AS
* Implement export of JSON 
* Implement sync with local storage


* Maybe add extras for generating a maze and other pattern like stuff

* Decide how to add attributes to objects and tiles, what is the need here, sprite fusion has attributes per tile and per tile instance

* Errors from updates of project state, don't want to throw in the console



* Change tile paint to not be a list of tiles but a grid of the tileset that the user can select multiple tiles from to paints with


- Change tileset tiles area to allow for multiple selection of tiles
- Can select area -> determine which tiles are included here and update selected state
- Update mouse move/mouse down of tilemap editor so that it paints all the selected tiles

- Update cursor GUI to use the selected assets as a cursor image so that user can see the tiles
