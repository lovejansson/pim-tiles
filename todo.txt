# Todo

Before GB town can be done 

* Select tool ->
    Move, 
    Delete,
    Copy and paste 

FILE 

* Implement Save

* Implement Save AS


Refactoring 

* Weird to keep CRUD API for projectstate when GUI updates it by updating the objects directly, for example layer name

* Errors from updates of project state, don't want to throw in the console

After


* Flood fill

* Pan when cursor moves out of view (useful if you want to move an object far away)

* Add a image next to the cursor to show selected asset that the user is painting with -> not necessary, adds clutter I think 

* Generate maze 

* Add animated tiles which consists of 1-4 tiles that are running an animation instead of a static image
