# Todo

Before GB town can be done 

* Slow performance for canvas need WEBGL 

* Select tool ->
    Move, 
    Delete,
    Copy and paste 

FILE & Export JSON

* Implement Save

* Implement Save AS

* Do testing for export and save project functions

Refactoring 

* Weird to keep CRUD API for projectstate when GUI updates it by updating the objects directly, for example layer name

* Errors from updates of project state, don't want to throw in the console


After

* API för projectstate tydligare att "areas" är en modul och inte listan av areas 

* Flood fill

* Pan when cursor moves out of view (useful if you want to move an object far away)

* Add a image next to the cursor to show selected asset that the user is painting with -> not necessary, adds clutter I think 

* Generate maze 

* Add animated tiles which consists of 1-4 tiles that are running an animation instead of a static image
