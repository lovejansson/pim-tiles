# Todo

Before GB town can be done 

* Select tool ->
    Move, 
    Delete,
    Copy and paste 

* Add attribute for a Tile

FILE 

* Implement Save

* Implement Save AS


After

* Errors from updates of project state, don't want to throw in the console

* Flood fill

* Pan when cursor moves out of view (useful if you want to move an object far away)

* Add a image next to the cursor to show selected asset that the user is painting with -> not necessary, adds clutter I think

* Generate maze

* Randomize placement of something within an area like trees

* Add animated tiles which consists of 1-4 tiles that are running an animation instead of a static image
