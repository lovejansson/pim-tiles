# Todo

* Finnish auto tile feature

* Add auto tile paints to history stack

* remove transparent parts from tiles when creating images / or make it posible to select multiple at ones (seems normal for tilemap editors)
 
FILE 

* Implement Save
* Implement Save AS
* Implement export of JSON 
* Implement sync with local storage


* Maybe add extras for generating a maze 

* Pan add drag of tilemap

* Decide how to add attributes to objects and tiles, what is the need here, sprite fusion has attributes per tile and per tile instance
